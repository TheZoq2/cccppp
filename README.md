##C/C++ for true comrades
### For C
1.Add the functions inside of the .bashrc file to your bashrc file so you can compile. It requires GCC because of foreign control (communism shall remain free)

2.Compile using 'ccpc filename.ccpc' (main.ccpc is an example program, always make sure to include the mandatory_ccpc_ideas.h file)

3.Enjoy the benefits of a communist programming language

Extras:
IDE's sadly are against communism and do not support color coding on .ccpc files.
THAT IS WHY WE DO NOT USE IDE'S
To help combat IDE'S, we have introduced 'ccpc-convert' and 'ccpc-unconvert'

They do exactly what they say, convert from c to ccpc using 'ccpc-convert' and unconvvert with 'ccpc-unconvert'

REMEMBER, C IS AN IMPOSTOR CAPITALIST LANGUAGE, DO NOT COMPILE IT
### For C++
